# Hello World!

As the common ritual goes, always start with a simple hello world 👋

```go
package main


import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, I'm Baily!")
}
```

I'm Baily a Buffalo based Software Engineer just trying out a few things on the weekends. I wouldn't consier myself a blogger, a vlogger or even a devlogger but eh when in Rome. 🏛️

## Who is this guy 👁️ 👄 👁️

I'm currently a Software Engineer on the R&D team at [ACV Auctions](https://www.acvauctions.com/) working on Django and iOS applications to help reduce churn for our Vehicle Condition Inspectors while bringing more trust and trancparency in the used car marketplace!

I used to work on an Infrastructure team where I primarily administered and developed tooling surrounding Kubernetes and Helm, however I wanted a change of pace working on more full stack development, where I hand more say in building pretty UIs.

On the side I like to spend time with my lovely girlfriend going on walks, binge watching Hulu and Netflix and trying various foreign cheeses 🧀

I've also started playing Battefront II on PC (I know I'm like 3 years late) but its really addicting, so if you have Origin for PC, **please please** reach out and lets play some time!

## What's next ☕

I've been working on a startup called [Latte](https://grabalatte.io) where we're building an iOS app to link mentors and mentees in a video/audio call environment. Being a native iOS developer at heart, it was a strange journey diving into React, JSX and CSS-type styling. However, I've started liking React Native for its ability to spin up a really slick looking UI and API handler in hours not days. Its especially powerful for POCs and hackathons where time is of the essence and tech-debt is less of an issue.

Expect to see a few React Native posts in the future, from how to setup your workspace, how to configure CI/CD with Github actions and fastlane to creating a robust style system/component library that matches what you design in Figma!

## One Last Thing

If I don't already know you, feel free to just say hi on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bailytroyer/) I promise I don't bite 😬
